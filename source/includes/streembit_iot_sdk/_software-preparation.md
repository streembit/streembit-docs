Follow the instructions to set up the CLI so that it can communicate securely with [https://www.streembit.co/](https://www.streembit.co/)  the user interface for IOT. It is important to understand that in order for the communication to function with the UI at the secure website of [https://www.streembit.co/](https://www.streembit.co/) we need to apply the SSL certificates into the root directory of the CLI and also make sure that the domain linked to the certificates is accurately referenced in the SSL module on the Config file.

In “step 3” you will notice this command
`$ node streembit --pwd=PASSWORD`
You may notice that instead of PASSWORD you will need to create your own password which is compliant in length and has upper, lower case letters and a number at least.

Adding the user public key from your account at [https://www.streembit.co/](https://www.streembit.co/) requires to follow the `user`  `add`  detailed in step 3 below.

*Fig 1*. - Shows the config file - which needs the  CMD set to true before running streembit cli on the raspberry pi to allow you to enter commands such as adding a user.

![alt text](./images/config-cmdinput.png "cmdinput set to true in config.json")

<aside class="notice">
You can also use `--cmd` flag in command line. the app started this way (so, `$ node streembit --pwd=PASSWORD --cmd`) will always bring up command line interface, independently of value of the "cmdinput" flag
</aside>

*Fig 2*. - Shows the UI view showing the public key which is needed to set up the user account on the CLI.  The Public key is a long string of characters - in Fig 2 below it starts with 049085a5

![alt text](./images/ui_pub_key.png "Public key on UI")

Follow the instructions carefully on step 4.

*Fig 3*. - Once you have got the relevant data you can then set up the IOT hub at UI [https://www.streembit.co/](https://www.streembit.co/)

<aside class="notice">
**Points of note in the config file**
The config file is the most likely source of any issues preventing the creation of the Peer to Peer secure Streembit IOT network. Incorrect setting of the flags ***true/false*** or typo’s in the syntax will prevent the application either running or connecting.
</aside>

Below are some guidance notes on how to view and interpret the elements of the Config file and the consequences of inputting this data incorrectly.

### Setting the flags

*Fig 4*. - Setting the flags

![alt text](./images/setting_flags.png "Setup IoT Hub on UI")

Making sure the IOT module detailed above needs to be set to true on the config file.  Also the “serialport” needs to match the naming convention of the Raspberry Pi serial port, which is listed above.  On certain config file examples you may see it listed as “com 3”  which is correct syntax for windows machines

The other modules in the config file then need to be set to false except for the following

    * SSL = true
    * Client = true
    * NFC = true
    * Dns = true

### Setting the mac address of the Zovolt Board

The config file requires the personalization of the *Zovolt expansion board / Hat* which is connected to the Pi via the usual serial block connector. This is done through the use of the *mac* address of the board and linked to the Zigbee radio chip on the board.

*Fig 5*. - An example on the IOT module of the config is shown below

![alt text](./images/iot_module.png "Example of IoT module")

The key data item which need’s modifying on this config file for your specific board is

**“Id” : “0013a20041679c00”**,

The long string is the mac address of the board.
Key to this information is to use lower case letters when editing the file. We find that despite the labels using upper case letters, the code relating to these identifiers for the mac address of the chip/board is most often lower case lettering.  - creating a mismatch in upper and lower case lettering can create additional bugs and unpredictable operation of the CLI application.

### Step 1

Since we are using encrypted connections which appear as WSS and HTTPS, the corresponding configuration is required in the config.json file.
Generate or obtain SSL certificates for your domain and include the certificate files in the ssl folder.

**Required files**
   - CA: ssl/DOMAIN.ca-bundle.crt
   - Certificate: ssl/DOMAIN.crt
   - Key: ssl/DOMAIN.key

### Step 2

Make sure you modify your *config.json* to resemble example above

For IoT the node: the *transport.host* field can be one of the following:

   - IP address - type the valid public static IP address of your device. The Streembit UI will try to connect to the IoT node via this static public IP address.
   - Domain name - type a domain name which DNS services is configured. The Streembit UI will connect to the IoT node via this domain name.
   - "" - empty string. By configuring the device with this option and define an empty string i.e "", the application will try to resolve the external (public) IP address of the device. The Streembit UI will connect to the IoT node via this resolved public IP address.

Notice that we are using domain names instead of IP addresses for the ssl cert configuration. This is important. Also there must be at least one valid seed, as well as run value in Client and IOT modules set to "*true*".
Please also note that the mac address listed in this config file is an example. You will need to use the mac address which is defined on the Zovolt board ‘Zigbee’ Radio chip.

### Step 3

```json
see shell tab
```
```shell
# Start the app by entering
$ node streembit --pwd=PASSWORD
# or
$ node streembit --pwd=PASSWORD --cmd

# corresponding to a chosen way of initialization
# next, Enter
user
# then
add

# ... and follow the prompts you see on a screen
```

To allow connection to this IoT CLI instance, a user must be defined and saved in the CLI local database.
In order to do this, open your Streembit UI, open "Tools" > "Account/network info" and copy the public key value.
At the CLI to allow command prompt input set the "cmdinput" parameter to "true" or use "--cmd" flag.

<aside class="notice">
Public key is the only mandatory field and you should fill it with your PKI public key of your account set up which was copied from the Streembit UI.
</aside>

### Step 4

```json
see shell tab
```
```shell
# Restart the app with the following command
$ node streembit --pwd=PASSWORD --data
```

Once the user is successfully added, stop the cli app. Open config.json and change "cmdinput" to false.

Copy the value of the *BS58 public key* of the hub (must be the last string of the output, or close to the last).
At the Streembit UI you must add this Hub to your IoT Hub list. Click on the "IoT Devices" menu item and click on "Create IoT Hub". Enter the IoT device ID. This is usually the Zigbee MAC of your device that sits top on the Streembit-cli Raspberry Pi (such as the Zovolt Zigbee gateway). Enter the device name and copy the BS58 public key of the streembit-cli that you gathered in the previous step. Click on Save and the web application should connect to your streembit-cli IoT instance.
The created IoT Hub should appear on the devices view that is accessible from the "My devices" link.
