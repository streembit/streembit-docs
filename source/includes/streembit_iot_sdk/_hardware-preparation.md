## Hardware preparation

### Zovolt gateway preparation

This is an optional step  - preparing the Zovolt Gateway ***before*** connecting to the Raspberry Pi

In some instances of development and where the Zovolt Board hasnâ€™t been pre-configured you will need to set the board up following these steps.

### XBEE MCU configuration - Connecting the FTDI serial converter to the Zovolt Zigbee Gateway

The XBEE module of the Zovolt IoT Zigbee Gateway can be programmed with an FTDI USB-to-Serial breakout board. The FTDI board can also connect the Zovolt Zigbee Gateway to the nodejs streembit-cli instance via serial line using the PC/laptop USB connector when the CLI runs on a PC/laptop.
The pin connection between the FTDI board and the Zovolt Zigbee Gateway:

**FTDI** | **Gateway-JP1**
--------- | -------
DTR (yellow) | Pin 1
RXI (blue) | Pin 4
TXO (green) | Pin 3
3V3 (red) | Pin 6
CTS (geeen) | Pin 2
GND (black) | Pin 5

The pictures display the FTDI and gateway wires.

### Write settings to the XBEE module

Install the DIGI XCTU configuration tool. This application must be used to configure the XBEE Zigbee MCU.
Using the DIG XCTU software the following settings within the XBee ZB SMT module would need to be set:
  * ZS: 2
  * AP: 1
  * AO: 3
  * EE: 1
  * EO: 2
  * KY: 5A6967426565416C6C69616E63653039
