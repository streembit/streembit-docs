## Commands

**Command line interface**

Set the "cmdinput" field to true in the config.json configuration file to intiate the command line handler. The command line handler accepts commands from the terminal. In "cmdinput" mode once the application is initialized there is a command prompt displayed: "Enter command type:"

**Add user**

```json
see shell code
```
```shell
$ usr
```

Enter the "usr" command type at the command prompt.

```json
see shell code
```
```shell
$ add

```The "Enter users command:" prompt will appear. Enter "add" to the command prompt.

Answer the prompt by typing the user name, public key, whether or not the user is an admin (1 or 0 value). The public key is the long PKI public key format that you can get from the Public key column of the "Account/network info" view, accessbile from the "Tools" menu at the Streembit UI application.
